Climate change is the one of the measure problem now a days, its impacting through out the globle. due to climate change we can notice the following impact such as Earth temperature change, raining pattern changed, sea level incresed and the glaciers in the Northern Hemisphere have started to melt. This caused more icebergs to drift into the ocean. Its time to protect over nature  to take important initiatives, it must be take by government, private compies and indivisuals.
	The government initiatives are effective and implement, for an example in Inida Delhi government introduced a Even and Odd method to save prevent same pollutions by using this mechnishm, this mechenishm allows only Even day only even number's vehicle can run and odd day only odd number's vehicle can run. At lease it will help to prevent the environment.
	Any private indivisual company must follow the poclicy to prevent the huge pollution, to follow their own rules. Employee must plan an importent role to follow companies roules such as company must provide echo friendly transporation such as electric cars, bikes and long distance car pooling facility.
	it is everybodies resposibility to save environment to follow the save tree and more plantation at leaset one indivisual can plant a tree.

	In the conslusion we can say that to save the environment is not a resposibility imposement, it should be done by heart. Government can initiates  the agenda every one must be supports it.
